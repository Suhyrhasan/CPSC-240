Platform and software 

The required platform for programming in this course is a Bash shell with access to the Debian repository of software. Here are the choices for a conforming platform.
1. Tuffix. This is the software used in the data structures course (CPSC 131). It uses the Debian repository and a Bash shell.
2. A Linux distro of your choice. Make sure it is a descendant of Debian such as MX Linux, Ubuntu, Mint, Xubuntu, Kali, Lubuntu, and several others. If you know how to install a Linux distro then choose this one.
3. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Windows already has the Bash shell built-in. When you go to use it for the first time, you will be asked to choose the distro. Be sure to choose one that is a descendant of Debian. Red Hat is not a descendant of Debian
If you are not sure which one to choose, then choose WSL because it is already present in every Windows computer. You simply have to activate it.
