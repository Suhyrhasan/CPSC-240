//To students in CPSC240:  This is my opinion.  I have studied the the available licenses for software especially the GPL,
//the LGPL, and the Affero GPL.  This is what I have learned about the LGPL used with this function "input_array using C++".
//   The section above the blank line is called the "copyright notice".
//   The section below the blank line is called the "license notice".
//   LGPL is for use on software typically found in software libraries.
//   This LGPL license applies only to the specific function named in the license.
//   This library may be used within another application covered by other licenses (or EULAs).
//   This license requires that source code of this function be distributed with the application (even if other parts of the
//       application are not required to be distributed with source code).
//   This LGPL allows you to re-distribute the function (provided the original LGPL remains).
//   This LGPL allows you to modify the function (provided the original LGPL remains).
//   This LGPL allows you to distribute (or sell) your modified versions to anyone (provided the original LGPL remains). 
//   When you distribute this software to other people a copy of the LGPL is suppose to accompany the source code in a 
//       separate file.  If that separate file becomes lost (by human error) license still has legal standing.
