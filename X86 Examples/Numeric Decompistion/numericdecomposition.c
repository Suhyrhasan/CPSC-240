//===== Background information ============================================================================================================================================
//
//During lab time many of you asked me for help in returning data from a called subprogram to the caller program.  Many times the question refers to the driver: How do I
//return more than one value to the driver?  This program is an example of how to do exactly that.
//
//There are really only two ways to pass data if one of the two (caller or called) is C (or C++).  The caller may pass data to the subprogram by value.  The subprogram
//may pass data back to the caller by pointer.  This example shows 4 values passed back to the caller using "pass by pointer".
//
//The so-called "pass by reference" is not a new technique of passing data, but rather it is a limited version of "pass by pointer".  Pass by reference does not exist in
//C-language; it exists in C++, thereby, helping to created a bloated C++.

//Appendix 1: A unusual solution to the problem of output in hex.

//The problem:  How does the programmer output a double in C (or C++) in hex format?
//You may think the answer is the following, but it is wrong.
//        double myfavorite = 3.1416;
//        printf("0x%016x",myfavorite);
//The problem is format specifier "%x" can only be used with integer data.


//Now the problem becomes how do you make C language think that the number is really an integer.  The wrong way is casting.  Suppose the following:
//        double myfavorite = 3.0;
//        long myinteger = (long)myfavorite [C style]   or  long myinteger = static_cast<long>(myfavorite);
//The problem above is that the bits of the original number 3.0 = 0x4000 8000 0000 0000 will be changed into 3 = 0x0000 0000 0000 0003.  You still cannot output the
//original number in hex.


//There is a way to make the software think you have an integer.  Here is the technique.
//         double * mynumber = new double (3.0);    //Now *mynumber holds 0x4000 8000 0000 0000
//         void * abstract = mynumber;              //Create a void * pointer and make it point to 0x4000 8000 0000 0000
//                                                  //Both *mynumber and *abstract are the same 8 bytes, namely: 0x4000 8000 0000 0000.
//         unsigned long * biginteger = abstract;   //Create an integer pointer and make it point to 0x4000 8000 0000 0000.
//                                                  //Now all 3 of these are names for the same 8 bytes: *mynumber, *abstract, *biginteger.
//         printf(0x%016X, *biginteger);            //Now the program language thinks you are outputting an integer, therefore, you are allowed to use the hex specifier.
//
//End of solution.

//Appendix 2: A C-language only solution.

//This program contains a few C-only statements. However, it can be easily converted to compile with a C++ compiler.  The following are modification needed to convert this
//program to a C++ program.

//Replace: double * number = malloc(1*sizeof(double));
//with     double * number = (double *)malloc(1*sizeof(double));

//Replace: char * sign = malloc(1*sizeof(char));
//with     char * sign = (char *)malloc(1*sizeof(char));

//Replace: long * trueexponent = malloc(1*sizeof(long));
//with     long * trueexponent = (long *)malloc(1*sizeof(long));

//Replace: unsigned long * significand = malloc(1*sizeof(unsigned long));
//with     unsigned long * significand = (unsigned long *)malloc(1*sizeof(unsigned long));

//Replace: unsigned long * longnumber = abstract;
//with     unsigned long * longnumber = (unsigned long *)abstract;

//It shows that some of the assignments permitted in C-language require the cast operation in C++.  One can conclude that C++ is a little more restrictive in type
//checking than C is.  Completing the conversion from C to C++ is left as a exercise for anyone interested in the comparison of languages.

//It is interesting to see how C++ has preserved some features from old C.  The allocator malloc is one example.  
//In C you allocate storage for an array of 10 doubles like this:          double * number = malloc(10*sizeof(double));

//In C++ you call the constructor for an array of 10 doubles like this:    double * number = new double[10];

//You cannot use the constructor "new" in C, but you can use the allocator "malloc" in C++.
