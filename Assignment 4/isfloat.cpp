 * Program name: "isfloat".  This is a single function distributed without accompanying software.  This function scans a
 * char array seeking to confirm that all characters in the array are in the range of ascii characters '0' .. '9'.Furthermore, 
 * this function confirms that there is exactly one decimal point in the string.  IF both conditions are true then a boolean 
 * true is returned, otherwise a boolean false is returned.  Copyright (C) 2020 Floyd Holliday

 *  Optimal print specification: monospace, 132 columns, 8Â½x11 paper
 *  Testing: This function was tested successfully on a Linux platform derived from Ubuntu.
 *  Compile: g++ -c -m64 -Wall -fno-pie -no-pie -o isfloat.o isfloat.cpp -std=c++17
 *  Classification: Library
 * 
 * Purpose 
 *  Scan a contiguous segment of memory from the starting byte to the null character and determine if the string of chars is 
 *  properly formatted for conversion to a valid float number.  This function, isfloat, does not perform the conversion itself. 
 *  That task is is done by a library function such as atof.
 * 
 * Future project
 * Re-write this function in X86 assembly.
